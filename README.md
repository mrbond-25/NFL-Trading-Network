# NFL-Trading-Network

A project to investigate NFL trading patterns using methods from social network analysis. 

## Data
The dataset consists of NFL trades from 2017 to 2022, and is obtained using the R package `nflreadr`.

## Network Methods and Visuals
I used the R package `igraph` for working with and visualizing networks. You can learn about the package [here](https://igraph.org/).
